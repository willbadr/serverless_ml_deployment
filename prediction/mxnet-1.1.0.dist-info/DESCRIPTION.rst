Prerequisites ------------ This package supports Linux, Mac OSX and
Windows platforms. If you have GPU, you may want to check:
`mxnet-cu91 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu91/>`__,
`mxnet-cu91mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu91mkl/>`__,
`mxnet-cu90 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu90/>`__,
`mxnet-cu90mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu90mkl/>`__,
`mxnet-cu80 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu80mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80mkl/>`__ with
CUDA-8.0 support, or
`mxnet-cu75 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu75mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75mkl/>`__ with
CUDA-7.5 support. If you are using Linux without GPU, you may want to
check `mxnet-mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-mkl/>`__ with MKL
support.
